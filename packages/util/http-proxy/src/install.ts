/**
 * The proxy environment a spawned child needs.
 *
 * A child inherits the parent environment, which this process rewrote to its own resolved policy.
 * Handing that normalization straight through would replace values the user set for other tools, so
 * each proxy name the user exported is restored to what they wrote: a SOCKS proxy `curl` uses is
 * not swapped for the HTTP one this package fell back to for that scheme.
 *
 * A scheme the user named in neither casing carries the resolved value instead of being removed.
 * Without that the child's routing silently diverges from its parent's: `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` does
 * not read `ALL_PROXY`, so a child of a parent that resolved its proxy from that name would connect
 * directly while the parent proxies.
 *
 * The bypass list is always the resolved one. It only ever adds the loopback entries to what
 * the user wrote, so nothing is lost, and the child stops sending its own localhost traffic to a
 * proxy that cannot route it.
 *
 * The flag reaches only Node 22.21+ and 24+; an older runtime keeps that child direct. Such a child
 * also matches bypass entries with Node's own `NO_PROXY` rules, which differ from this package's in
 * their separators and IPv4-range support. Non-Node children (curl, git, pnpm) ignore the flag and
 * read the variables themselves.
 *
 * The flag is withheld when a proxy value the child receives is one this package refused. Node
 * parses `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` under that flag before running the program, and exits on a
 * scheme other than `http:` or `https:` — so a SOCKS value kept for `curl` would stop every Node
 * child from starting. Without the flag such a child connects directly, as this process already
 * reported for that scheme, and `curl` still reads the value it was kept for.
 *
 * A worker thread is deliberately NOT served here — it must not receive a proxy URL that may carry
 * credentials.
 *
 * @returns names to apply to the child environment, where `undefined` means remove, or an empty
 *   object when no proxy is active.
